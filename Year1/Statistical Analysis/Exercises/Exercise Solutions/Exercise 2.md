## Question a

$\large{consump = A e^{\alpha \hspace{2mm} price}}$

$\large{ln(consump) = ln(A e ^{\alpha \hspace{2mm} price})}$

$= ln(A) + \alpha \hspace{2mm} price$

We now have a linear model in them form 

$\large{y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X}$

where 
- $y = ln(consump)$
- $\beta_0 = ln(A)$
- $\beta_1 = \alpha$
- $X = price$

The fit is more linear in the log case

## Question d

When prices are 6 cents per pound, we get that consumption is 70 pounds.
